"""Process-wide shared SessionDB registry.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-17)
----------------------------
A bare ``SessionDB()`` mints its own writer connection, its own lock, its own
close-time WAL checkpoint and its own token-writer thread. Two of them on the
same ``state.db`` can race: one connection's close-time ``wal_checkpoint`` can
overlap another's growth, which is the lost/reordered-page-write corruption
class this module exists to forbid (#100896 / #102827 upstream).

This module owns that boundary: **one shared ``SessionDB`` per resolved path per
process**, refcounted.

PROVENANCE
----------
This module was ported from the upstream agent tree, where the same concern is
solved. It is NOT a verbatim copy: upstream had decomposed its 10.8k-line state
module into a state core plus a common-helpers module and a db-file module, and
its registry imported helpers from those. This tree still ships the
**monolithic** ``openamer_state.py``, so this port:

  * drops the upstream ``stat_db_file_identity`` helper and inlines the
    equivalent (a two-int ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` identity probe, guarded for
    Windows),
  * drops the upstream ``RetiredGenerationCaptureError`` (that module does not
    exist here) and keeps the generic close-quietly path,
  * resolves the default DB path from ``openamer_state.DEFAULT_DB_PATH``
    instead of the upstream ``_default_db_path()`` helper.

The two call sites in this tree use exactly two entry points:
``acquire(path)`` and ``release_or_close(db)``.

LIFECYCLE
---------
- ``acquire(path)`` returns the current generation for *path* and bumps its
  refcount.
- ``release(db)`` decrements the refcount of the generation *db was acquired
  from* (object-keyed, so an inode replacement cannot strand a still-owned
  generation); the final release tears it down.
- ``release_or_close(db)`` is the drop-in for a plain ``db.close()``: it
  releases a shared instance, or closes a non-shared one (CLI one-shots,
  read-only opens, test fakes).
- On inode change the old generation is RETIRED (never lent again) but stays
  alive until its holders release.
- All teardown happens OUTSIDE the registry lock, so a final release's WAL
  checkpoint never stalls acquisition for every state.db.

A missing shared registry is silent by design here: callers catch ImportError
and fall back. That silence is exactly why the omission went unnoticed for a
day — see the module docstring in ``acp_adapter/session.py``.
