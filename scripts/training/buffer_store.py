"""Buffer Store — single source of truth for the online experience buffer.

Every writer (active_learn, internet_learner, online_learning.collect_new)
must append through `append()` so the cap is enforced on EVERY write, not
only in the replay branch. Before this module the cap lived inside
online_learning's replay path, so any cycle that produced new data grew the
buffer without bound (training on unbounded duplicates degrades loss).

Cap policy: keep the newest MAX_BUF examples, FIFO. Trimming is
best-effort/atomic-ish (write temp + replace) and never raises into callers —
a failed trim must not break a learning cycle.

Quality policy (added 11.09.26): the buffer is TRAINING DATA. Three classes
of non-signal were observed live in online_buffer.jsonl and are now rejected
before they can be written, because a LoRA fine-tuned on them learns the
garbage:

  1. reasoning-trace leaks  — thinking models emit "Here's a thinking
     process:" / "Analyze User Input:" into the completion (64 of 300
     entries on 11.09.26).
  2. degenerate repetition  — "Self\\n\\nSelf\\n\\nSelf..." (20 of 300):
     the model repeating one token; unique-token ratio near zero.
  3. raw tool-call JSON     — the completion is `{"tool": "web_search", ...}`
     instead of an answer (28 of 300).

`is_junk()` is the single predicate; `append()` refuses junk and returns the
unchanged count. Callers that need to report honestly check `is_junk()` (or
the count delta) rather than assuming their write landed.
