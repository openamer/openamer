# hf-cloud-sagemaker-iam-preflight

**Description:** Ensure a usable SageMaker execution role exists before deploying or training. Use this skill whenever about to create a SageMaker endpoint, model, training job, or any resource that requires an execution role. Use it especially when the user has not provided a role ARN explicitly, when scripts are about to call `iam:CreateRole`, or when an AccessDenied error mentions an IAM action. Never blindly call `iam:CreateRole` — always check for existing roles first. This skill prevents the most common SageMaker deployment failure: trying to create IAM resources from an SSO principal that has no IAM write permissions.
