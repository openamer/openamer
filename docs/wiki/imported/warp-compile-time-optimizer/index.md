# warp-compile-time-optimizer

**Description:** Use when compile time or startup time is the problem in code that uses Warp: a request to improve, optimize, or cut compile times; an app that is slow to start or stalls at the first wp.launch; seconds of compiling before real work begins; JIT modules recompiling on every run or every CI job. Only applies when the code being optimized uses Warp kernels. Not for steady-state kernel runtime, memory, correctness, building Warp itself from source, or nvcc/C++ build times.
