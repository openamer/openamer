# warp-debug-gradients

**Description:** Use to diagnose and fix incorrect gradients in differentiable Warp programs. Anything trained, optimized, calibrated, or fit through Warp kernels depends on wp.Tape gradients, so treat any misbehavior of such a workflow as a gradient problem until proven otherwise — use this when training diverges or NaNs, won't train at all, stalls or plateaus above the expected loss, converges to a wrong or biased answer, is worse than a reference implementation, works at small scale but fails at production scale, or fails a QA/validation recheck. Also for explicit symptoms — exploding, NaN/inf, zero, or subtly wrong gradients, suspected wp.Tape/backward issues, gradcheck failures — but users usually describe only the surface symptom ("the sim explodes", "the fit gets dragged toward outliers") without mentioning gradients: make that leap. Not for forward-only Warp work, build/install problems, or autograd issues in other frameworks without Warp.
